This repository exists to track the numerous suggestions I've made to FreshBooks accounting software.
No code is provided in this repository.

FreshBooks is a good (not great) way to get started for a small business.  Elements of the system are
fabulously effective and easy-to-use.  Unfortunately, FreshBooks also has a large number of
small-to-medium annoying blemishes that, collectively, signififcantly detract from its effectiveness.
It is particualrly frustrating to me to have spent significant time reporting issues and to have zero
transparency into their product development.

I hope that this repo provides at least a bit of transparency and pressure on FreshBooks to improve more quickly.

For the record, FreshBooks customer service team is among the best I've encountered. Bug and feature submissions
to FreshBooks are usually triaged very quickly by people who know the system well.
