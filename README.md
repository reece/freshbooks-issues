# FreshBooks Public Issues

*this repo is about, but not affiliated with, freshbooks.com*

This repository exists to provide some transparency for suggestions to the [FreshBooks](https://freshbooks.com)
accounting software. At a minimum, it will help *me* track the issues I've submitted since they do not provide
such a mechanism.  This repository does not contain code.

FreshBooks is a good (alas, not great) way to get started for a small business.  Elements of the system are
fabulously effective and easy-to-use.  Unfortunately, FreshBooks also has a large number of
small-to-medium annoying blemishes that, collectively, signififcantly detract from its effectiveness.
Fixing these issues is moving at a snail's pace.
It is particualrly frustrating to spend time reporting issues and to have zero
transparency into when/if the issues will ever be resolved.

For the record, FreshBooks customer service team is among the best I've encountered. Bug and feature submissions
to FreshBooks are usually triaged very quickly by people who know the system well.
